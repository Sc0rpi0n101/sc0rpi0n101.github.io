      <description>&amp;ldquo;On two occasions I have been asked [by members of Parliament!]: &amp;lsquo;Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out ?&amp;rsquo; I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question.&amp;rdquo; — Charles Babbage
