This is the repository for my blog [Sc0rpi0n's Journey](https://sc0rpi0n101.github.io).
I use Hugo to render the blog and this repository holds the rendered html files. 

IF you fix any problems with the blog, feel free to add an issue to the Issue Tracker

You can also reach out to me @sc0rpi0n101 at twitter.
