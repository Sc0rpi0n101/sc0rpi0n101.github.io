      <description>Hello Everyone, I am Sc0rpi0n101(Nikhil Maan). I am a Junior at Amity University, Noida with a Computer Science Major. I am a student developer and I have worked with C/C++ for a few years and Python for a few months. I am also learning Fortran currently for my GSoC project and plan to learn full stack Python development in the hope of creating my websites and this blog in full stack instead of Hugo.</description>
